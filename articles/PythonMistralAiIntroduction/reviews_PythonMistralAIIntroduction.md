# Introducing MistralAI: A Powerful Language Model Rivaling ChatGPT

MistralAI is a cutting-edge large language model (LLM) developed by a French start-up. Positioned as a competitor to ChatGPT, MistralAI offers impressive capabilities in terms of power, ease of use, speed, and affordability. This model has been specifically designed to process extensive and complex texts with great efficiency.

In this article, I will guide you on how to use MistralAI to create a Medium Article Editor similar to the one I previously developed and published [here](https://medium.com/@quentin.astegiano/unlocking-the-power-of-chatgpt-revolutionize-your-technical-article-editing-d6ae637698ba).

## Prerequisites

To get started with MistralAI, you will need an API key, which you can obtain by signing up on their [website](https://mistral.ai/). The pricing for MistralAI is token-based and quite economical: <https://docs.mistral.ai/platform/pricing/>. A typical round trip will cost a few hundred tokens at most, and the most affordable model is priced at 0.14â‚¬ per million input tokens and 0.42â‚¬ per million output tokens. Additionally, MistralAI allows you to set a usage limit (such as 5 or 10â‚¬ per month) to prevent overspending.

This tutorial will use Python, so ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

1. Set up a virtual environment and install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install mistralai 
pip install python-dotenv
```

2. Create a `.env` file and add your secret API key:

```ini
MISTRAL_API_KEY=[YOUR API KEY]
```

## Verifying the Setup

Before diving into building the Medium Article Editor, let's first test the connection to MistralAI and ensure everything is working correctly.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from mistralai.models.chat_completion import ChatMessage

load_dotenv()

from mistralai.client import MistralClient

client = MistralClient()
response = client.chat(
    model="mistral-tiny",
    messages=[ChatMessage(role="user", content="What is MistralAI ?")],
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

This code snippet initializes the virtual environment, creates a client, and sends a simple question to the MistralAI model. With the setup complete, you should receive a response like:

```bash
$ python sources/main/mistral.py
Mistral AI is a cutting-edge company based in Paris, France, developing large language models. I am delighted to be one of the models developed by Mistral AI. Our models are designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input they receive. They can be used for various applications such as text generation, translation, summarization, and question-answering.
```

## Building a Medium Article Editor with MistralAI

Now that you have confirmed the connection to MistralAI, let's build a Medium Article Editor using MistralAI's language model.

1. Create a class, `MistralEditor`, to manage the entire process:

```python
class MistralEditor:
    _client = MistralClient()
```

2. Implement the `ask_mistral()` function to interact with the MistralAI API:

```python
def ask_mistral(self, system_role: str, query: str) -> str:
    completion = self._client.chat(
        model="mistral-small",
        messages=[
            ChatMessage(role="system", content=system_role),
            ChatMessage(role="user", content=query),
        ],
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content
```

3. Implement functions to generate a title, editor review, subtitle, and closing statement:

```python
def generate_title(self, content: str) -> str:
    # ... Implement the function here ...

def generate_review(self, content: str) -> str:
    # ... Implement the function here ...

def generate_subtitle(self, content: str) -> str:
    # ... Implement the function here ...

def generate_closing_statement(self, content: str) -> str:
    # ... Implement the function here ...
```

4. Implement the `edit_article()` function to manage the entire editing process:

```python
def edit_article(self, editor_file: str) -> str:
    # ... Implement the function here ...
```

5. Finally, utilize the `MistralEditor` class to edit your article:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    editor = MistralEditor()
    new_article = editor.edit_article("article.md")
```

By following these steps, you can create a MistralAI-powered Medium Article Editor that can review your articles, correct your mistakes, and help you write better articles.
