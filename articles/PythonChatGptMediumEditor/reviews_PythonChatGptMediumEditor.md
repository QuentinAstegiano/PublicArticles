Introducing: The Power of ChatGPT for Editing Technical Articles


# The Importance of Professional Editing for Technical Articles

Editing is an essential skill when it comes to crafting high-quality written content. Authors greatly benefit from having a professional editor to help refine their work. However, if engaging the services of a human editor is not an option, there's an alternative solution: leveraging ChatGPT.

In this article, we will explore how to use Python to create a program that utilizes ChatGPT for editing articles. Before we begin, there are a few prerequisites you'll need:

1. A ChatGPT API token.
2. A Python 3 environment.

If you're not sure how to set up your environment, refer to my guide titled "Unlocking the Potential: A Guide to Using ChatGPT from Python".

## Building the ChatGPT-based Editor

### Generating the Reviewed Article

To start, we need to create a function that can make simple calls to ChatGPT and retrieve the results. You can find the complete Python script on GitHub (link provided below).

Here's an example of what this function looks like:

```python
def ask_gpt(self, system_role: str, query: str) -> str:
    completion = self._client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": system_role,
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": query},
        ],
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content
```

The first task is the actual editing process. As always, the prompt plays a crucial role. 

For this step, we load the content of the article we want to edit and send it to ChatGPT for revision. We ask ChatGPT to correct any mistakes, enhance clarity, and reformulate the text, just as a human editor would do.

```python
def generate_review(self, content: str) -> str:
    print("Generating editor review...")
    role = """
        You are a skilled editor specialized in technical articles published on the internet.
        Review the provided article, correct any writing mistakes, and reformulate when necessaryâ€” even if it involves rewriting entire sentences. Create actual sentences when they are missing.
        Aim to enhance clarity, improve grammar, and refine the overall writing quality.
        Also aim to maximize reader engagement throughout the article.

        Ensure that code snippets remain intact.        
    """
    return self.ask_gpt(role, content)
```

The output generated by ChatGPT may not be ready for immediate use, but it serves as a valuable starting point for further improvements.

Why stop at just editing? ChatGPT is capable of more than just correcting text. We can also use it to generate additional content for our article, such as a title, introduction, or closing statement.

Let's create some additional functions to make the most of ChatGPT's capabilities.

### Generating a Title

All the functions we'll create follow a similar pattern: we prompt ChatGPT for particular content, such as a compelling title, and pass in the article's content.

```python
def generate_title(self, content: str) -> str:
    print("Generating title...")
    role = """
        You are a skilled editor specialized in technical articles published on the internet.
        Write the best possible title for this article to grab readers' attention and maximize engagement.
    """
```

### Generating a Subtitle or Introduction

These prompts are relatively simple, but you can make them more sophisticated by adding constraints, such as limiting the length of the introduction or specifying the overall purpose of the generated content.

```python
def generate_subtitle(self, content: str) -> str:
    print("Generating subtitle...")
    role = """
        You are a skilled editor specialized in technical articles published on the internet.
        Propose an engaging introduction for the following article that will grab readers' attention.
        The introduction must be less than 200 characters long.
    """
    return self.ask_gpt(role, content)
```

### Generating a Closing Statement

Finally, let's generate a conclusion to summarize the article and provide further perspective. These prompts are tailored for technical articles, but feel free to create your own prompts that align with your specific content.

```python
def generate_closing_statement(self, content: str) -> str:
    print("Generating closing statement...")
    role = """
        You are a skilled editor specialized in technical articles published on the internet.
        Write a suitable conclusion for the given article, summarizing its content and offering insights into next steps.
    """
    return self.ask_gpt(role, content)
```

### Bringing It All Together

All that's left to do is to call these functions and compile the final edited text.

```python
def edit_article(self, editor_file: str) -> str:
    print(f"Editing article {editor_file}")
    with open(editor_file, "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        edited_content = self.generate_review(content)
        title = self.generate_title(edited_content)
        subtitle = self.generate_subtitle(edited_content)
        closing_statement = self.generate_closing_statement(edited_content)

        final_content = f"""
            # {title}
            
            {subtitle}

            {edited_content}

            # Conclusion

            {closing_statement}
        """

        splitted = editor_file.split(os.sep)
        if len(splitted) == 1:
            splitted = [".", splitted[0]]

        target = os.sep.join(splitted[0:-1]) + os.sep + f"reviews_{splitted[-1]}"

        with open(target, "w") as target_file:
            target_file.write(final_content)
            print(f"Saving edited article to {target}")
            return target
```

By calling this function and providing the path to your article file, it will create a new file next to your original article, prefixed with "review_". This file will contain the edited version of your article.

```bash
$ python3 sources/main/editor.py ./PythonChatGptMediumEditor.md
Editing article ./PythonChatGptMediumEditor.md
Generating editor review...
Generating title...
Generating subtitle...
Generating closing statement...
Saving edited article to ./reviews_PythonChatGptMediumEditor.md
```

For demonstration purposes, I used this script on the example article mentioned above.
