**Maximizing Product Classification with Mistral AI**

Welcome to this engaging exploration of Mistral AI's capabilities! In this article, we will create a practical and real-world tool that classifies products by extracting their technical characteristics from descriptions. This hands-on experience will not only demonstrate Mistral AI's power but also equip you with the knowledge to build similar tools for various applications.

**Real Use Case: A Product Classifier**

To begin, we'll use Mistral AI to build a product classifier for desktop computers. We will extract technical features like the processor, RAM type, and hard drive from product descriptions. This information will then be stored in a user-friendly format for easy comparison and analysis.

**Preparing Sample Data**

First, let's collect sample data for desktop computers from Amazon. For each product, we'll gather:

* Product URL
* Product title
* "About this product" text
* Product description

The sample data set is available [here](https://github.com/QuentinAstegiano/PublicArticles/blob/main/articles/MistralAiProductClassifier/sources/resources/desktop_pc_sample.csv). Here's a snapshot of the data:

```csv
URL,Title,About,Description
https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Business-19-5-Dual-Core-Processor/dp/B0CCF99RFQ,Lenovo All-in-One Business Desktop, 19.5‚Äù HD+ Display AIO, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD,Processor: Intel Celeron J4025 Dual Core, 2.0, Up to 2.9GHz Graphics: Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 600 Operating system:Windows 11 Pro Memory: 16GB DDR4 RAM Hard Drive: 256GB M.2 PCIe SSD + 1TB HDD Optical Drive: Yes
```

**Setting Product Classification Objectives**

Our goal is to use Mistral AI to extract specific product characteristics from the raw data. Once we have these details, we will save them in an easily accessible file for future use.

**Building the Tool**

To create our product classifier, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate the Mistral AI capability for product data classification.
2. Define a prompt to extract desired characteristics like the processor, RAM, and hard drive.
3. Call Mistral AI for each product to extract the characteristics.
4. Save the extracted data in a user-friendly format.

Here's the complete source code for the project: <https://github.com/QuentinAstegiano/PublicArticles/blob/main/articles/MistralAiProductClassifier/sources/main/MistralClassifier.py>

**Extracting Characteristics with Mistral AI**

First, let's create a function that asks Mistral AI to classify the product data:

```python
def _ask_mistral(self, product, characteristics: List[str]) -> str:
    system_role = f"""
    You are an automation system that takes a product data input and outputs a
    dictionary of extracted characteristics from that data. Extract from this
    data about a product the value of each of those fields: {', '.join(characteristics)}
    The output must be a dictionary in the following format:
    {
        'field1': 'value1',
        'field2': 'value2'
    }
    The output should only contain the dictionary and should be precisely
    formatted as required. Only the 'value' should be replaced by the actual
    value extracted from the data. There should be no other content in the
    response.
    """

    response = MistralClient().chat(
        model="mistral-tiny",
        messages=[
            ChatMessage(role="system", content=system_role),
            ChatMessage(role="user", content=product),
        ],
    )

    content = response.choices[0].message.content
    if not content.startswith("{"):
        content = content[content.index("{"):]
    return content
```

This function uses the `mistral-tiny` model, which is well-suited for this type of extraction and more cost-effective than other models.

**Processing Data with Pandas**

We will use the `pandas` library to manage and process our data:

```python
def _extract_characteristics(
    self, df: pd.DataFrame, source_columns: List[str], characteristics: List[str]
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df['Combined'] = df[source_columns].apply(
        lambda x: ', '.join(x.dropna().astype(str)), axis=1
    )

    df['Mistral'] = df['Combined'].apply(
        lambda x: self._ask_mistral(x, characteristics)
    )

    df['Mistral'] = df['Mistral'].apply(ast.literal_eval)
    result = df.join(pd.json_normalize(df.pop('Mistral')))
    return result
```

**Classifying Products**

Finally, we will create a `classify_products` function to classify the products and save the data:

```python
def classify_products(
    self, source_file: str, characteristics: List[str], source_columns: List[str]
) -> str:
    df = pd.read_csv(source_file)
    columns_to_keep = [
        c for c in df.columns.tolist() if c not in source_columns
    ]

    df = self._extract_characteristics(df, source_columns, characteristics)
    selected_columns = columns_to_keep + characteristics

    target_file = source_file.replace(".csv", "__extracted.csv")
    df[selected_columns].to_csv(target_file)

    return target_file
```

**Example of Usage**

To use the product classifier, simply call the `classify_products` function:

```python
source_file = "./sources/resources/desktop_pc_sample.csv"
extracted_file = MistralClassifier().classify_products(
    source_file=source_file,
    source_columns=["Title", "About", "Description"],
    characteristics=["CPU", "GPU", "Amount of RAM", "Type of RAM"],
)
```
